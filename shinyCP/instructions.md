## Initial settings
  
_C atoms min_ and _C atoms max_: is the range of number of carbon atoms to generate. Minimum value is C=3 and maximum is C=30. 
  
_Cl atoms min_ and _Cl atoms max_: is the range of number of chlorine atoms to generate. Minimum value is C=3 and maximum is C=30.  
  
_Add adducts/fragments_: refers to the formula of adducts and/or fragments to generate from a set list of available options. Multiple selections are possible.  
  
_[CP]_ and _[CO]_: refers to either chlorinated paraffins [CP] or chlorinated (mono)olefins [CO]. 
  
_[xx-yy]_ or _[xx-yy-zz]_: where _-yy_ or _-yy-zz refers to the adduct/fragment ions. Currently, a limited selection is available but more can be added later if requested.  
  
_[xx]-_ and _[xx]+_ refers to the charge of the ion (limited to single charged species, +1 or -1).  
  
[M+Cl-HCl]- can be written as [M-H]-  
  
_Isotope rel ab threshold (%)_: is the threshold for relative abundance for isotopologues for each chemical formula of the adduct/fragment ion. 
  
## Output table  
  
_Parent_Formula_: the chemical formula of the molecular ion.  
  
_Charge_: The charge of the ion.  
  
_Fragment_: The fragment and isotopic type of the ion species.  
  
_Frag_MonoIso_Formula_: the chemical formula of the adduct/fragment ion.  
  
_Isotopologue_: the isotopologue in relation to the monoisotopic ion.  
  
_Isotope_Formula_: the exact isotopic formula of the adduct/fragment ion.  
  
_m/z_: the mass-over-charge of the adduct/fragment ion.  
  
_Rel_ab_: the relative abundance of the different isotopologues of each adduct/fragment ion.  
  
_12C, 13C, 1H, 2H, 35Cl, 37Cl_: the number of atoms for each element
